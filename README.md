# Gmail Textify

**Chrome extension that enables voice dictation inside Gmail!**

To use, begin by cloning the repo, running "npm install", and adding a .env file to the root directory of the project with your OpenAI API key (format should be VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR KEY}). Then, run "npm run build". Finally, navigate to the Extensions tab on Chrome, enable Developer Mode in the top right, and click "Load unpacked" - upload only the "dist" folder that was created in the project's root directory.

After these steps, the extension should be ready to use! Would appreciate any feedback :)
